            <h1>Genesis of the Blogging App</h1>
            <p>This blogging app was originally a Codeup project - a free-standing, multi-user blogging application,
            written and implemented in SpringBoot and Java.</p>
            <p>I've repurposed it a bit - both to host my vanity site but also to allow <em>me</em> to blog on this site.</p>
            <p>This is, of course, both better and worse than what it originally was. It's quite a bit more optimized this way,
            quite a bit faster, and quite a bit more stylish than it originally started out.</p>
            <p>But it's also quite a bit less robust than it originally was - again, you can no longer create an account as a new user
            and begin blogging - I've locked up the functionality that would allow anyone else to use this app.</p>
            <p></p>
